Everyone must be able to:

Write a for loop that counts from a to b (example, from 0 to 9 or from 1 to 10)

compute the Sum of the numbers in a loop

Compute the product of the numbers in a loop

If you cannot compute these simple things, you will have great
difficulty in passing the course


Math:

convert the following to binary:
13 =
73 =
155 =

convert the following hex to binary
0xFEDC1234 =
0xABAB5353 =
0xDEADBEEF =

write a table showing a single hex digit 0 through F and the 4 bits
that correspond to each

Write a table showing a single octal (base 8) digit 0 through 7 and
the 3 bits corresponding to each

In unix, permissions on a file are shown using three letters r, w, x
meaning can be read, can be written, can be executed.

Here is a typical  permissions: -rw-r--r--
if the - means 0 and the letter means 1, we can write this as:

-rw-r--r--
0110100100

forgetting about the first bit, we have 9 bits. Express the number as three octal digits
rw-r--r--
110100100

the command to set this permission would be:

chmod _____ filename

For a 3-digit computer, write a table showing what each bit combination means if we interpret the number as signed integer, or unsigned integer

For a 32-bit computer, like ARMv6, what is:

0xFFFFFFFE + 0x00000003 =
